= Versionaire

Ruby doesn't provide a primitive version type by default so Versionaire fills this gap by providing immutable and thread-safe {semver_link} so you can leverage versions within your applications. This new `Version` type behaves and feels a lot like other primitives (i.e. `String`, `Array`, `Hash`, etc) and can even be cast/converted from other primitives.



toc::[]

== Features

* Provides _strict_ {semver_link} which means `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.
* Provides immutable, thread-safe version instances.
* Converts (casts) from a `String`, `Array`, `Hash`, or `Version` to a `Version`.
* Disallows `<major>.<minor>.<patch>-<pre-release>` usage even though {semver_link} suggests that you _may_ use pre-release information.
* Disallows `<major>.<minor>.<patch>+<build_metadata>` usage even though {semver_link} suggests that you _may_ use build metadata.

== Requirements

. https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby].

== Setup

To install, run:

[source,bash]
----
gem install versionaire
----

Add the following to your Gemfile:

[source,ruby]
----
gem "versionaire"
----

== Usage

=== Initialization

A new version can be initialized in a variety of ways:

[source,ruby]
----
Versionaire::Version.new                            # "0.0.0"
Versionaire::Version[major: 1]                      # "1.0.0"
Versionaire::Version[major: 1, minor: 2]            # "1.2.0"
Versionaire::Version[major: 1, minor: 2, patch: 3]  # "1.2.3"
----

=== Equality

==== Value (`+#==+`)

Equality is deterimined by the state of the object. This means that a version is equal to another
version as long as all of the values (i.e.Â state) are equal to each other. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
version_a = Versionaire::Version[major: 1]
version_b = Versionaire::Version[major: 2]
version_c = Versionaire::Version[major: 1]

version_a == version_a  # true
version_a == version_b  # false
version_a == version_c  # true
----

Knowning this, versions can be compared against one another too:

[source,ruby]
----
version_a > version_b                    # false
version_a < version_b                    # true
version_a.between? version_c, version_b  # true
----

==== Hash (`#eql?`)

Behaves exactly as `#==`.

==== Case (`#===`)

Behaves exactly as `#==`.

==== Identity (`#equal?`)

Works like any other standard Ruby object where an object is equal only to itself.

[source,ruby]
----
version_a = Versionaire::Version[major: 1]
version_b = Versionaire::Version[major: 2]
version_c = Versionaire::Version[major: 1]

version_a.equal? version_a  # true
version_a.equal? version_b  # false
version_a.equal? version_c  # false
----

=== Conversions

==== Function

Use the `Versionaire::Version` function to explicitly cast to a version:

[source,ruby]
----
version = Versionaire::Version[major: 1]

Versionaire::Version "1.0.0"
Versionaire::Version [1, 0, 0]
Versionaire::Version major: 1, minor: 0, patch: 0
Versionaire::Version version
----

Each of these conversions will result in a version object that represents "`1.0.0`". When attempting
to convert an unsupported type, a `+Versionaire::Errors::Cast+` exception will be thrown.

==== Refinement

Building upon the examples shown above, there is an even more elegant solution where you can use
this gem's built-in link:https://www.alchemists.io/articles/ruby_refinements[refinement] support:

[source,ruby]
----
using Versionaire::Cast

version = Versionaire::Version[major: 1]

Version "1.0.0"
Version [1, 0, 0]
Version major: 1, minor: 0, patch: 0
Version version
----

By adding `using Versionaire::Cast` to your implementation, this allows Versionaire to refine
`Kernel` so you have a top-level `Version` conversion function much like Kernel's native support for
`Integer`, `String`, `Array`, `Hash`, etc. The benefit to this approach is it reduces the amount of
typing, doesn't pollute your entire object space like a monkey patch would, and provides a idiomatic
approach to casting like any other primitive.

==== Implicit

Implicit conversion to a `String` is supported:

[source,ruby]
----
"1.0.0".match Versionaire::Version[major: 1]  # <MatchData "1.0.0">
----

==== Explicit

Explicit conversion to a `String`, `Array`, `Hash`, or `Proc` is supported:

[source,ruby]
----
version = Versionaire::Version.new

version.to_s     # "0.0.0"
version.to_a     # [0, 0, 0]
version.to_h     # {major: 0, minor: 0, patch: 0}
version.to_proc  # #<Proc:0x000000010b015b88 (lambda)>
----

To elaborate on procs further, this means the following is possible:

[source,ruby]
----
using Versionaire::Cast

version = Version "1.2.3"

version.to_proc.call :major               # 1
[version, version, version].map(&:minor)  # [2, 2, 2]
----

=== Inspections

You can inspect a version which is the equivalent of an escaped string representation. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
using Versionaire::Cast

Version("1.2.3").inspect  # "\"1.2.3\""
----

=== Comparisons

All versions are comparable which means any of the operators from the `+Comparable+` module will
work. Example:

[source,ruby]
----
version_1 = Versionaire::Version "1.0.0"
version_2 = Versionaire::Version "2.0.0"

version_1 < version_2                    # true
version_1 <= version_2                   # true
version_1 == version_2                   # false (see Equality section above for details)
version_1 > version_2                    # false
version_1 >= version_2                   # false
version_1.between? version_1, version_2  # true
version_1.clamp version_1, version_2     # version_1 (added in Ruby 2.4.0)
----

=== Math

Versions can be added, subtracted, sequentially increased, or sequentially decreased from each
other.

==== Addition

Versions can be added together to produce a resulting version sum.

[source,ruby]
----
version_1 = Versionaire::Version[major: 1, minor: 2, patch: 3]
version_2 = Versionaire::Version[major: 2, minor: 5, patch: 7]
version_1 + version_2  # "3.7.10"
----

==== Subtraction

Versions can be substracted from each other as long as there isn't a negative result.

[source,ruby]
----
version_1 = Versionaire::Version[major: 1, minor: 2, patch: 3]
version_2 = Versionaire::Version[major: 1, minor: 1, patch: 1]
version_1 - version_2  # "0.1.2"

version_1 = Versionaire::Version[major: 1]
version_2 = Versionaire::Version[major: 5]
version_1 - version_2  # Versionaire::Errors::NegativeNumber
----

==== Up

Versions can be sequentially increased or given a specific version to jump to.

[source,ruby]
----
version = Versionaire::Version[major: 1, minor: 1, patch: 1]
version.up :major     # => "2.1.1"
version.up :major, 3  # => "4.1.1"
version.up :minor     # => "1.2.1"
version.up :minor, 3  # => "1.4.1"
version.up :patch     # => "1.1.2"
version.up :patch, 3  # => "1.1.4"
----

==== Down

Versions can be sequentially decreased or given a specific version to jump to as long as the result
is not negative.

[source,ruby]
----
version = Versionaire::Version[major: 5, minor: 5, patch: 5]
version.down :major     # => "4.5.5"
version.down :major, 3  # => "2.5.5"
version.down :minor     # => "5.4.5"
version.down :minor, 3  # => "5.2.5"
version.down :patch     # => "5.5.4"
version.down :patch, 3  # => "5.5.2"
version.down :major, 6  # => Versionaire::Errors::NegativeNumber
----

=== Extensions

This project supports libraries which might desire native `Version` types. Each extension _must be
explicitly required_ in order to be used since they are _optional_ by default. See below for
details.

==== OptionParser

link:https://github.com/ruby/optparse[OptionParser] is one of Ruby's
link:https://stdgems.org[default gems] which can accept additional types not native to Ruby by
default. To extend `OptionParser` with the `Version` type, all you need to do is add these two lines
to your implementation:

. `require "versionaire/extensions/option_parser"` - This will load dependencies and register the
  `Version` type with `OptionParser`.
. `instance.on "--tag VERSION", Versionaire::Version` - Specifying `Versionaire::Version` as the
  second argument will ensure `OptionParser` properly casts command line input as a `Version` type.

Here's an example implementation that demonstrates full usage:

[source,ruby]
----
require "versionaire/extensions/option_parser"

options = {}

parser = OptionParser.new do |instance|
  instance.on "--tag VERSION", Versionaire::Version, "Casts to version." do |value|
    options[:version] = value
  end
end

parser.parse! %w[--tag 1.2.3]
puts options
----

The above will ensure `--tag 1.2.3` is parsed as `{:version=>#<struct Versionaire::Version major=1,
minor=2, patch=3>}` within your `options` variable. Should `OptionParser` parse an invalid version,
you'll get a `OptionParser::InvalidArgument` instead.
